# Fourier Coefficients in the BKM Formalism

Since the calculation of this shit is so large, we have to write a document to remind ourselves what exactly is going on. The main point is below:

Calculation of the cross-section involves computing tons of Fourier Coefficients that are obtained via fancy mode expansion in a particular gauge or coordinate system, probably lightcone gauge or something like that. It is further complicated by the fact that the fancy-sounding process of electroproduction of real photons can happen in two different ways at tree level or something. Since there are two processes that show up at the amplitude level, the square of the amplitude becomes even more of an pain. Please see what is happening below:

$$ |\mathcal{M}|^{2} = |\mathcal{M}_{1} + \mathcal{M}_{2}|^{2} = |\mathcal{M}_{1}|^{2} + |\mathcal{M}_{2}|^{2} + \mathcal{M}_{1} \mathcal{M}_{2}^{*} + \mathcal{M}_{1}^{*} \mathcal{M}_{2}. $$

## Bethe-Heitler Process:

### BKM02:

#### Unpolarized Target:

Three coefficients:

##### $c_{0, \text{unp}}^{BH}$

##### $c_{1, \text{unp}}^{BH}$

##### $c_{2, \text{unp}}^{BH}$

#### Longitudinally-Polarized Target:

Two coefficients.

##### $c_{0, \text{LP}}^{BH}$

##### $c_{1, \text{LP}}^{BH}$

#### Transversely-Polarized Target:

Two coefficients.

##### $c_{1, \text{TP}}^{BH}$

##### $s_{1, \text{TP}}^{BH}$

### BKM10:

In the BKM10 Formalism, the BH process is regarded as a contamination. Because of this, there is no re-expression of the Fourier Coefficients in the BH process. Therefore, we use the *same* coefficients as the ones in the BKM02 formalism.
