# Amplitude Squared Contributions

There are three contributions.

## Bethe-Heitler Process:

## Deeply-Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) Process:

## Interference:

The contribution from the interference terms are a major pain. We have to iterate through $n \in \left{ 0, 1, 2, 3 \right}$ and compute $s_{n}^{I}$.
